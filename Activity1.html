    <h1>See Through - The Band CAMINO</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You know how to keep me waiting<br>
        You know there's a call that you missed<br>
        You know that I get impatient<br>
        'Cause I know you saw that shit
    </p>

    <p>You got me on the back burn, baby<br>
        You got me staying up all night<br>
        You got me in a situation<br>
        But you gotta know this isn't right
    </p>

    <p>Got me out here<br>
        Got me thinking what I would do<br>
        Got me in my head<br>
        Got me wishin' I was with you<br>
        Got me wishin' I was with you
    </p>

    <p>I'll be outside, I've been cooped up<br>
        Bloodshot eyes, need a ride, will you pick up?<br>
        Couldn't get it right, and you're sleeping on me now<br>
        Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow
    </p>

    <p>Rebound, feelin' like a re-run<br>
        Everything that we've done<br>
        Funny how it all played out<br>
        You're good at looking at me like I'm see-through<br>
        But I gotta see you<br>
        I should've learned by now
    </p>

    <p>How do I get your attention?<br>
        How does it feel to always have mine?<br>
        How do I address this tension?<br>
        How you're lookin' through me every time?
    </p>

    <p>Got me out here<br>
        Got me thinking what I would do<br>
        Got me in my head<br>
        Got me wishin' I was with you<br>
        God, I'm wishin' I was with you
    </p>

    <p>I'll be outside, I've been cooped up<br>
        Bloodshot eyes, need a ride. Will you pick up?<br>
        Couldn't get it right, and you're sleeping on me now<br>
